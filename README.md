You can recreate the demos in the talk using the steps outlined below.

## Dev Containers in GitHub Codepaces

If you have access to GitHub CodeSpaces, click the green "<> Code" button at the top right on this repository page, and then select "Create codespace on main". (GitHub CodeSpaces is available with [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise) and [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/).)

Now, browse to the file [explore-analyze-data-with-R/solution/challenge-Data_Exploration.ipynb](explore-analyze-data-with-R/solution/challenge-Data_Exploration.ipynb). Work through the Jupyter Notebook.

To open RStudio Server, click the Forwarded Ports "Radio" icon at the bottom of the VS Code Online window.

In the Ports tab, click the Open in Browser "World" icon that appears when you hover in the "Local Address" column for the Rstudio row.

This will launch RStudio Server in a new window. Log in with the username and password `rstudio/rstudio`. 

* NOTE: Sometimes, the RStudio window may fail to open with a timeout error. If this happens, try again, or restart the Codepace.

In RStudio, use the File menu to open the `/workspaces`, folder and then browse to open the file `devcontainers-rstudio` / `explore-analyze-data-with-R` / `solution` /  `all-systems-check` / `test.Rmd`. Use the "Knit" submenu to "Knit as HTML" and view the rendered "R Notebook" Markdown document.

* Note: You may be prompted to install an updated version of the `markdown` package. Select "Yes".
